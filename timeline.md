1. What's your timeline for your current project? (e.g., what sequence of goals do you anticipate working on between now and early December?)

I have roughly 5 weeks to build my project
Week 1 (by next Friday): Begin building bare-bones chrome extension
Week 2: Add functionality to chrome extension to finish MVP
Week 3: Begin user study
Week 4: Finish user study and begin paper
Week 5: Finish paper

2. What's the current iteration of your need thesis?
   People who use the internet for research have a difficult time remembering locations within long pages that they may want to revisit and why they these locations are important.

3. What's your current iteration of your approach thesis?
   I will create a Chrome extension that has an interface of a folder structure. Each folder represents a URL, and each leaf of a folder represents a page location within the URL along with a text note as to why the page location is important. The user can highlight text in a URL, type a note, and save it to the chrome extension.

4. What evidence have you collected so far in support of either, if any?
   I have asked my pair research partners how they currently save this information. They say they have tried different ways like noting in Notion, but current methods are not the most organized. I go on to ask them if my solution would be helpful, and many say it would be as long as it's super light weight.

5. What implementation choices have you made so far, if any?
   a.) I've chosen to make it a chrome extension so that it can be easily accessed within the browser

6. What's your riskiest risk right now, in terms of writing the final paper you wish to write?
   One risk is assuming that I can build this out despite having never built a Chrome Extension. Another risk is not having enough evidence of a need for this product.
